# [The Amazing JavaScript Race](http://www.nodejshouston.com)

## How Long Do I Run For?

No, not that type of race. The Amazing JavaScript Race is an interactive javascript challenge. AJR is open to any student interested in learning programming and javascript. First each "racer" will learn from a series of unique code challenges. Then every racer will form teams of 3-4 to advance to the next Levels of AJR. We will keep everything fun, simple, and stress-free so that your group has a blast.

Working together, teams will explore places through a series of fun challenges. Tasks include solving javascript challenges, finding inscriptions on historic sites, and taking creative photos.

After completing each challenge, teams earn points and badges on the Leaderboard. The code snippet is part of the overall puzzle code for the challenge question. When all teams have successfully retrieve all the code snippets, the fun can begin.

Points and Badges will be displayed on the Leaderboard, which can be earned by attending Houston Nodejs meetups/talks and by contributions to the many projects. The leaderboard will showcase the total points accumulated.

## Vision

The Amazing JavaScript Race will help students for a future career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by providing underserved students more access to unique, hands-on learning opportunities in STEM and by bringing coding to more schools across Houston.
